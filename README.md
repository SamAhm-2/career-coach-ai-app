# AI-Powered Career Coach Assistance Application

An AI-powered web application built with **Amazon Q Apps** that automates skill-gap analysis and training recommendations for Career Coaches at Career4All.

---

## Overview

Career4All's coaching team previously relied on a manual, time-consuming process to review CVs, identify skill gaps, and recommend training programs. This project replaces that workflow with an automated, scalable solution using **Amazon Q Business** backed by **Amazon S3** as a dynamic data source.

Coaches upload a learner's CV and a target job description — the application returns:
- A **skill gap analysis**
- **Personalized training recommendations** drawn from the course catalog
- A suggested **learning schedule**
- Support for **coach-driven refinements** via natural language input

## Architecture

| Component | Service |
|---|---|
| AI Application | Amazon Q Apps (within Amazon Q Business) |
| Document Index | Amazon Q Business retrieval index |
| Course Catalog Storage | Amazon S3 (`course-catalogueshub`) |
| Identity & Access | AWS IAM Identity Center |
| Access Control | Amazon Q Business ACL (JSON) |
| Content Moderation | Amazon Q Business Global Controls |

## Application Cards

The Q App is structured with the following input and output cards:

**Input Cards**
- CV upload
- Job profile / job description upload
- Coach recommendation input (free text)

**Output Cards**
- Skill gap analysis
- Training recommendations
- Suggested learning schedule

## Data Sources

Two data sources are connected to the Amazon Q Business index:

1. **Manually uploaded PDF** — Static course catalog uploaded directly into Amazon Q Business.
2. **Amazon S3 bucket** (`course-catalogueshub`) — Coaches upload course catalog files here; a **daily sync** keeps the index up to date automatically.

## Access Control

Course access is restricted by coach expertise using an ACL configuration file applied to the S3 data source.

**File:** `config/access-control-list.json`

```json
[
  {
    "keyPrefix": "s3://course-catalogueshub/Data/Security/",
    "aclEntries": [{ "Name": "CareerCoaches", "Type": "GROUP", "Access": "ALLOW" }]
  },
  {
    "keyPrefix": "s3://course-catalogueshub/Data/Medicine/",
    "aclEntries": [{ "Name": "CareerCoaches", "Type": "GROUP", "Access": "DENY" }]
  }
]
```

**IAM Identity Center Groups & Users**

| Group | Users |
|---|---|
| CareerCoaches | career.coach.one, career.coach.two |

## Content Moderation

Keyword blocking is configured in Amazon Q Business under **Admin Controls and Guardrails → Global Controls**.

Blocked keywords: `Gambling`, `Casino`, `Self-harm`, `Attack`

These words are automatically filtered from all query responses.
